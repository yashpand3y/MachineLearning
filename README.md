# MachineLearning
Machine Learning Models I created with datasets either referenced from python libraries or attached in respective directory
Most of the functions are performed through Pandas and Numpy. Further, I've used SKLearn library to cross-reference my results (between the algorithm I implemented, and the one available in the library)
